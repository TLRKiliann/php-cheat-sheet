## From zero to hero

3 folders with different level :

- php-basic
- php-intermediate
- php-advanced

---

## Motivation

It's been a long time since I learned PhP. I've now joined a team of developers working on a project using PhP with DP (design Pattern) MVC. I've often thought it would be important to do a tutorial on this code. I hope it will prove useful to help someone else!
