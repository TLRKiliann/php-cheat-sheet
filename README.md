## From zero to hero

3 folders with different level :

- php-basic
- php-intermediate
- php-advanced

---

## Motivation

It's been a long time since I learned PhP. But without revision code, it's so easy to forget.
I've often thought it would be important to do a tutorial on this code. Otherwise, it will be an eternal restart, if I need to work on the backend or something like that or with PhP rules (public, private, static, etc).
I really needed to do this ! Hope this will help someone else !
